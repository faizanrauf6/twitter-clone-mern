# Twitter Clone MERN - README

Welcome to the Twitter Clone App! This application is built using ReactJs for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It allows you to create different posts / tweets and share lovely moments with friends and family. They can like each other posts as well as they follow other persons in the application. Backend Res APIs and authentication is done using Node.js and Express.js. This README will guide you on how to set up and run the project.

## Frontend Setup

To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the `client` folder: `cd client`
